# About  

ISARA is an open-source Python codebase that models ambient aerosol optical and microphysical properties using user-inputted field campaign instrument data sets. 
This software calculates these properties separately for fine-mode and coarse-mode particles at the wavelength(s) and relative humidity (RH) level(s) of choice. 
ISARA also has the capability to handle spheroids and other irregularly-shaped particles. These features enable comprehensive evaluations of incredibly complex 
and diverse sets of aerosol particle profiles encountered within field campaigns. We hope that the community uses this software to streamline verification of field 
aerosol data sets and ultimately advance field campaign data quality assurance. More information on this software including installation and use can be found in 
"User Guide". Click here to access code repository. 

## Objective

The goal of this page is to provide FOSS learners with an idea of what (hopefully) a well constructed GitHub repository should look like.

Throughout FOSS, learners will be given the opportunity to reinforce their knowledge through self-paced assignments: a novel topic will be covered each week, and at the end of the lesson learners will be asked to add their newly gained knowledge to their own GitHub repository. This repository aims to be a reference learners can use when adding to their own work.
